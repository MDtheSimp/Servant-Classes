# Servant Class: Rider ((Main info))
Class Rider and Heroic Spirit of the Mount, is one of the Four Cavalry Classes among the seven standard Servant classes summoned for the Holy Grail War. Servants placed within this Class are those known for riding mounts, whether living beasts or human constructs, during their lives. There are even some cases where legendary animals have been summoned as a Servant such as Vánagandr and Red Hare. They generally have lower attributes compared to the Three Knight Classes, but the abilities of the mounts described in their legends compensate by granting them powerful Noble Phantasms or abilities. They have the class abilities of **Magic Resistance** and a high rank in **Riding**, allowing them to fully utilize the abilities of their mounts. Depending on the rank, they can take full control of everything from simple horses, modern machinery like motorcycles and planes, and even Divine Beasts. Dragons are the only exception as the ability to ride them falls under a different Skill; however, rare exceptions do occur.

## Hit Points((+Hit Points))

10 plus your Constitution Modifier. 
You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.
)
# Servant Proficency((+Servant Proficency))

As a servant, your initial proficiencies function in a different manner compared to standard classes. 
Whenever your proficiency rank in **Attacks** and **Defenses** would normally increase to match your current rank, increase it by one additional rank instead (for example: if you are a fighter with a master proficiency in melee weapons at level 1, once your fighter class grants you master proficiency in weapons, your proficiency would then increase to legendary). This is capped at one rank above legendary, which is termed 'mythic,' resulting in an additional +2 on top.

## Spirutal body((+Spirutal body))
Servants are made of **Ether** one of **Five Great Elements**, on it's own it is amorphous and is incapable of materializing by its own power, with the power of the grail, the servants are able to gain a material form with a **Spiritual Core** serving as "their center, their heart, their CPU" that dictates their every function. While a servant may bleed and take damage to their organs, their true being resides in a Spiritual Core.

Servants are beings able to **switch** between a **Spiritual Body** and **Material Body** at will, although at a rate no faster than **once per minute**. While in spiritual form, they cannot be easily detected by enemies due to being **invisible** to the naked eye and most forms of scrying, or be affected by physical interference. They can travel where they please without being impeded by walls, but they also **cannot carry anything** in that state. Their senses are limited to spiritual sensations (*a sort of vague sense imagine being in the etheral plane but without your normal senses*), so they must materialize in order to fully experience normal senses when sharing a visual link with their Master. Their upkeep cost is low when not materialized, so many Masters prefer them to stay in spirit form when they are not fighting or doing other tasks that require them to be in physical form to lower the cost on themselves.
=
Other servants can easily sense and interact with a servant in spirit form, while a magus may find it difficult to do so.

***While in spirit form, your speed doubles, but you incur a -4 status penalty to AC (Armor Class), Perception and reflex saves, you are also flat-footed. Additionally, you are unable to make attacks or cast spells.***

## Dying and unconsious conditions((+Dying and unconsious))

As a servant, you do not fall unconscious when reduced to 0 hit points. Instead, you maintain consciousness but incur a **penalty** equal to **twice** your **dying value** on all rolls (such as damage rolls, saves, and checks).

Note that it is still possible to acquire the **unconscious condition** through other means.

Additionally, effects with the **death trait** that reduce your hit points to 0 only increase your dying value by 3, instead of causing immediate death.

###THE RIDE
As a Rider, you are inherently bonded to a Ride, which reflects the essence of your noble phantasm. Your Ride takes one of the following forms: 
* If it is a living creature, it uses the statistics of an animal companion.
* If it is a vehicle, it uses the statistics of a construct companion. For vehicles that are Huge or larger, it instead uses the appropriate vehicle stat block.

As a single action :a:, you summon your ride to a space within 60 feet. The space must be large enough to accommodate the ride. Unsummoning your ride requires another action. 
If your Ride is destroyed or killed, it dissipates and can be resummoned at full health after 24 hours. If your Ride is unsummoned while injured, it fully recovers its health after 1 hour and can then be resummoned in perfect condition.
Any abilities or features you gain that affect familiars, animal companions, construct companions, or vehicles also apply to your Ride. These benefits are translated into an appropriate equivalent, such as upgrading your Ride to a mature animal companion or an advanced construct companion where applicable.




####Making the ride 
item(
When creating your ride, follow these guidelines based on whether your ride is an animal companion, construct companion, or vehicle. Adjust the base stat block according to the rules below:

### Animal or Construct Companion
Choose an appropriate stat block or build your companion using established rules, then apply the following modifications:
* **Speed Increase:** Increase its Speed by 10 feet.
* **Hit Points:** Increase its Hit Points by 10.
* **Ability Modifiers:** Increase all ability modifiers by 1.
* **Size:** Increase its size to Medium or Large if its current size prevents you from mounting it.
* **Actions:**
  - Add a one-action attack if it lacks one.
  - Add a two-action ability if it lacks one.

### Vehicle
Choose or design an appropriate stat block using established rules, then modify it as follows:
* **Defensive Adjustments:** Modify its AC and Fortitude saves by the level difference between you and the vehicle:
  - For each 5 levels (5, 10, 15, 20), increase or decrease these values by 2.

)
=
item(
            - For example, if you are Level 1 with a Level 13 vehicle, reduce its AC and Fortitude saves by 16 (12 + 4 
               from thresholds).
* **Hardness:** Set the vehicle's Hardness based on your level:
  - Level 1: Hardness 5
  - Level 5: Hardness 10
  - Level 10: Hardness 15
  - Level 15: Hardness 20
  - Level 20: Hardness 25
- **Hit Points:** Set the vehicle's Hit Points to 25 per your character level.
- **DCs:** All DCs for collisions or abilities use the higher of your Class DC or Spell DC.
- **Piloting:** The vehicle is always considered manned and requires no piloting check. Any "wind-up" trait is ignored.
- **Actions:**
  - Add a one-action attack if it lacks one.
  - Add a two-action ability if it lacks one.

### Ride Advancement
As your Riding skill improves to rank **B**, **A**, and **EX**, you gain access to higher-level phantasmal species or more advanced rides. Upon reaching each rank, you can apply up to **two upgrades** to your ride. Work with your GM to determine specific enhancements. Examples include:
- Additional abilities.
- Stat increases.
- New movement types or improved existing ones.  

These upgrades are cumulative and reflect your ride's increase in power as you gain control over higher ranked .
)

item(
# Act as one :aa:
-
You and your Ride act as one. Either you or your eidolon takes an activity that requires 2 actions, and then the other takes a single action.


)
###RIDING
A skill that denotes a Servants ability to ride mounts and vehicles.

item(
#Riding skill
-
* **D rank**: Capable of riding familiar animals and vehicles from your past life. 
Gain access to **the ride feat**, with the ability to **mount** as a **free action**, and you receive **no reflex save penalties** while riding. Additionally, **whenever you move**, your Ride can move in your stead.
)
|
item(
* **C rank**: Can flawlessly manage most beasts and vehicles and with minimal training, though unable to ride **Phantasmal Beasts** and **Magical Beasts**. When attacking with a weapon while mounted, add a ***status bonus*** to damage, equal to ***twice the weapon's damage dice***. Adittionally you and your Ride do not share **multiple attack penalty**.
* **B rank**: Proficient with most animals and vehicles, including **Magical Beasts** and those from beyond your lifetime. Weapons gain the ***jousting trait*** if they don't already possess it. You also do not need to move ***10 ft*** for jousting trait's bonus. Additionally, you can command your Ride as a ***free action*** once per round.
* **A rank**: Able to use all vehicles and creatures as mounts including **Phantasmal Beasts**, but not **Divine Beast** ranks. Your Ride receives a **+30 ft speed bonus**, and can now **act** during your turn with **an additional action** :a: beyond its usual actions.

While mounted, you and your Ride **share all active benefits** affecting either of you, including spells, conditions, and bonuses. **Neither** you nor your Ride can be **slowed, immobilized, or stopped** by difficult terrain or environmental conditions, unless caused by a **Noble Phantasm** or a similarly powerful effect. Your Ride gains **2 additional actions** :a::a: on your turn. If your Ride is destroyed, you can **immediately summon it again** as a single action :a: , ignoring the 24 hour cooldown.

)
###MAGIC RESISTANCE ((+Magic resistance))
Magic Resistance grants protection against magical effects. Differing from the Resistance effect that merely rejects Magical Energy, this ability cancels the spells altogether.

item(
#Magic Resistance 
-
* **D rank**: When targeted by a spell that is **below half your level**, you receive a **+2 status bonus on saves and AC**.
* **C rank**: You gain resistance **5** to the damage from spells **equal to half your level or less**.
* **B rank**: As a reaction :r:, when targeted by a spell that is **equal to half your level or less**, you may attempt to **counteract** the spell using your weapon's attack bonus. The counteract level is **equal to half your level, rounded up**. If you **successfully** counteract the spell, you are unaffected by it, unless you choose to be. The counteract **DC** is the **spell's save DC plus half the spell's level**.
)
=
item(
* **A rank**: Counteracting spells now requires only a **free action** :f:. Additionally, once per day, you can turn one spell save into an **automatic critical success**.
* **EX rank**: "**Ma##C? On M#eE#eE?**" You **reflect** spells back to the caster when you **succeed at a counteract check**.

)

###Noble phantasms ((+Noble Phantasms))
Noble phantasms are powerful armaments made using human imagination as their core, and are the weapons and/or abilities owned by Heroic Spirits. As humanity's illusions, **they embody the ultimate Mysteries of a hero as symbols of their existence through historical fact and anecdotes**.

They can be physical weaponry (e.g. swords, spears, bows) or support items (e.g. shields, rings, crowns). They can also be abstractions such as unique, often magical abilities (even close to or matching True Magic), unique (even conceptual) means of attack, curses, and changes to the very environment and its physical properties. When summoned as Servants in the Holy Grail War, they are the trump cards of the heroes that allow them to overcome others in battle.

A servant may possess more than one Noble Phantasm; however, the more they have, the weaker each tends to be compared to possessing a single Noble Phantasm. Noble Phantasms also follow the skill ranking system **(D | C | B | A | EX)**, with higher-ranked Noble Phantasms being more powerful.

Noble Phantasms are classified by their effectiveness against enemies. One Noble Phantasm may have multiple classifications depending on its abilities. The classification and properties of the Noble Phantasm dictate both the number of times it can be used and the duration required for the NP to 'recharge'.
* **Anti-Unit**- Anti-Unit Noble Phantasms are those specialized against defeating other people in single combat. Compared to stronger weapons, a 

        majority of Anti-Unit Noble Phantasms will not 
        go beyond defeating other beings.

* **Anti-Army** - Anti-Army Noble Phantasms are those with a wide enough range to be specialized against armies. They are more powerful weapons than Anti-Unit Noble Phantasms, capable of easily blowing them away, but they must be used more wisely because of their larger cost.
* **Anti-Fortress**  - This rank has powerful Noble Phantasms that can even blow away solid fortified structures. While the difference between Anti-Unit and Anti-Army is the variation in area of effect, Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasms are distinguished from other categories by the great difference in power.
|
* **Barrier** - The classification of Noble Phantasms used to create barriers, typically Bounded Fields, but it does not include those that are also used to attack.

There are numerous additional classifications for Noble Phantasms, including but not limited to Anti-Self, Anti-Country, and Anti-Purge.
###Class Skills and Personal Skills ((+Class and Personal skills))
Skills are the embodiment of a Servant's various abilities and characteristics (Riding skill, Magic Resistance etc). They are divided into two main categories: **Class Skills**, which are typically connected to the Servant's Class, and **Personal Skills**, which reflect abilities or anecdotes connected to the life and legend of the Servant themselves. Personal Skills typically outweigh Class Skills in impact.

Again, a servant may possess numerous Class and Personal Skills; however, they tend to be stronger when their number is fewer.
info (
# Progression ((+Progression))
* **Class Skills**: From level 1, you have access to all your Class Skills, but they all start at their lowest rank, D. To progress a particular skill, you must retake the corresponding feat, which will increase its rank by one degree. This approach provides an incredible amount of versatility in your choice of Class Skills. All servant classes begin with two Class Skills at level 1 and acquire additional skills as they level up.
* **Personal Skills**: Similar to Class Skills, Personal Skills start at rank D and progress in the same manner, requiring the retaking of the same Personal Skills. The key difference is that Personal Skills progress at a much slower rate, starting at level 3 and advancing every 3 levels (as indicated by the ***'+++'*** symbol in the advancement table on page 2). Additionally, Personal Skills are not provided by the class and must be created in collaboration with your Dungeon Master."
* **Noble phantasms**: Noble Phantasms follow the same progression rules as Personal Skills, with the difference being that they advance at an even slower rate, starting at level 5 and increasing every 5 levels. This progression allows for a maximum of four advancements in a Noble Phantasm. The classification of a Noble Phantasm also plays a significant role. It is highly unlikely for a servant to possess more than one Anti-Army or Anti-Fortress NP, whereas an Anti-Unit NP is subject to fewer restrictions.
)
=
info(
# A RANK
Your skills can only get to A Rank after reaching **level 10**. If your class provides you with a class skill advancement that would increase your rank to A before level 10, you may **substitute** that advancement with a **Saber feat** appropriate for your level.
# EX RANK
It is impossible to reach an EX rank simply by retaking a Class or Personal Skill from A rank. The only way to attain EX rank is through an **in-game secret**, which you may or may not discover. (To clarify, uncovering the secret will increase your rank by one and unlock the potential to reach EX rank, but it will not grant EX rank immediately, unless you are already at A rank in that specific skill).
)

## The Master's blade 2nd
With unwavering vigilance, you protect your master from harm, swiftly intercepting any attacks directed at them. You gain the Master's Blade reaction, enabling you to use your weapon to protect your Master from harm's way.


###The Master's Ride :r: 
-

**Trigger** Your master is attacked by an enemy affected by a hazard while they are within your ride's speed.
-
item(
In response to the attack, your ride immediately moves up to its speed towards your master. Upon reaching them, your master automatically mounts the ride, even if there is no available space. The ride intercepts the attack or hazard, taking all damage and effects on behalf of your master.
After intercepting, the ride strides again, up to its movement speed. If you are already mounted, you determine the direction of this second stride. If this action would reduce the ride to 0 Hit Points, it completes the movement before disappearing.

This movement does not provoke reactions.
)

##Cavalry Weapon specialization 7th 

You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the means you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with attacks and spells in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re legendary. Your minions also gain this benefit.


#Rider CLASS FEATS ((Rider class feats))
|
item (
#SHIELDER
-
The Shielder skill elevates the use of a shield into a focal point of martial strategy. With this skill, a shield becomes a versatile tool that influences the entire battlefield. It harmonizes defense with offense.
* **D Rank**: You gain the **Shield Block** feat. If you already have the **Shield Block** feat, increase your shield's Hardness by half your level. Additionally, you gain a shield-related feat appropriate for your level, which you may swap each time you level up.
* **C Rank**: While your shield is raised, all creatures of your choice within your reach gain the circumstance bonus to AC. Furthermore, you can use **Shield Block** and similar features for attacks on creatures benefiting from your raised shield.
* **B Rank**: You can use a shield with at least 1 HP remaining as though it were unbroken. Whenever you use the **Shield Block** reaction, you may recall knowledge about the attacker or use any skill feat or skill check that requires no more than 1 action :a: as a free action :f: instead, with a +2 circumstance bonus to the check.
* **A Rank**: At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction :r: that you can use only to **Shield Block**. When using the **Raise Shield** action, you may reduce the action cost of your next action by 1 :a: to a minimum of 1. You can also attempt to repair shields that are destroyed as an action :a:, but this only restores them to 1 HP if you succeed.
* **EX Rank**: When you use the **Shield Block** feat, the shield's Hardness is doubled against that attack. Additionally, you may reflect the damage you blocked back at any enemy within reach. You can raise your shield as a free action :f:.
)
item(
#INDEPENDENT ACTION (NEEDS REWORK)
-
Independent Action is the ability to remain independent even when rejecting the Magical Energy supply from one's Master; the ability that allows for action even in the absence of the Master. Independent Action is the Class Skill of the Archer class.
At higher ranks, Servants can stay in this world longer without a contract, independently from the Master's Magical Energy. This allows Masters to focus on larger spells, or maintain the Servant even if they're unable to supply Magical Energy due to injury. However, these Servants are harder to control and retain, making Command Spells the only reliable method of commanding them.
* **D Rank**: It is possible for a Servant to stay in the world for **eight hours without a Master**.
)
=
item(
* **C Rank**: It is possible for a Servant to stay in the world for **one day without a Master**.
* **B Rank**: It is possible for a Servant to stay in the world for **two days without a Master**. However, this is the ideal value achieved by maximally conserving mana and avoiding battle and NP usage.
* **A Rank**: It is possible to take action even without a Master. However, to use NPs of great magical energy consumption, backup from the Master is necessary. At Rank A, it is possible for a Servant to stay in the world for about **a week without a Master**.
* **EX Rank**: At EX rank, Independent Action allows for nearly any act, whether related to combat or otherwise, to be undertaken without support from the Master.
)


item (
#SWORDSMANSHIP
-
Swordsmanship is a skill that transcends ordinary combat techniques, and through rigorous training and discipline, you have honed this martial practice into a lethal craft. Your blade, guided by precision and tactical acumen, becomes a tool for both offense and control on the battlefield.
* **D Rank**: Your attacks of opportunity impose a -10-foot status penalty to the target's Speed until the start of your next turn. Additionally, you can make an attack of opportunity when a creature within your reach makes an attack against someone other than you.
* **C Rank**: Upon critically hitting a target with a Strike, you can immediately attempt to use any skill feat or skill check that requires no more than 1 action :a: as a free action :f: instead. For Disarm, Trip, Shove, or Grapple you use the same multiple attack penalty as the Strike.
* **B Rank**: You've honed your ability to disrupt magic with your attacks. You can make an attack of opportunity when a creature within your reach casts a spell. If your attack hits, you can attempt to counteract the spell. Make a counteract check using your attack bonus against the spell's DC. Your counteract level is equal to half your character level, rounded down.
* **A Rank**: At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction :r: that you can use only for Attacks of opportunity. Once per round, if you hit and deal damage with an attack of opportunity, you can immediately make a Strike against that creature at a -5 penalty. If this Strike critically hits, the target becomes enfeebled 2 until the end of your next turn.
)
|
item (
* **EX Rank**: Grandmaster's Mark - You have reached the zenith of martial prowess. Once per round, when you hit with an attack, you may choose to forgo dealing damage to apply a Grandmaster's Mark to the target until the end of your next turn. A marked creature that provokes an attack of opportunity from you allows you to make that attack as a free action :f: (this does not consume the additional reaction from A Rank). If you hit a marked creature with an attack of opportunity, the Strike automatically becomes a critical hit.
)
Item(
#Marksmanship
-
The Marksmanship skill is ideal for combatants who specialize in firearms and tactical ingenuity. It focuses on adaptability, precision, and clever environmental utilization. Users can modify their attacks, ricochet shots, and integrate seamless reloading.

When you **attack with a thrown or ranged weapon**, you can have **the projectile ricochet** off a solid surface. This attack incurs a **-1 penalty to hit** but deals an additional **1d6 damage** on a successful hit. You can ricochet a projectile up to **4 times consecutively**, accumulating penalties and bonuses, although a hit or miss on a creature **ends the sequence**. Each ricochet **extends the range of a thrown weapon** by half its original range from the point of impact. Certain actions that enable multiple projectile attacks may allow **ricocheting between projectiles**.
* **B Rank: Efficient Loader** - Your rapid, precise reloading melds seamlessly into combat's rhythm. When **reloading** a firearm, you can perform an **activity** that requires **no more actions than the reload** as a free action :f:. This activity cannot be an **Attack or Casting a Spell**.

Item(
* **A Rank: Endless Bounce** - If your ricochet **misses a creature**, you can continue the chain until **you hit or reach your ricochet limit**, as long as there's a solid surface to bounce from. Additionally, on a **critical hit** with a ricochet, you can immediately make another **free-action :f: ricochet** against a **different target within range**, without increasing your ricochet count. This does not increase **the penalty or damage bonus**.
* **EX Rank: Boundless Reflections** - Your ricochet limit **increases to 10**. Once per day, as a free action :f: for **1 minute**, you can reverse the **ricochet penalty to become a bonus**. During this state, you cannot intentionally **MISS**.

This flexibility shows your mastery in utilizing every part of your weapon effectively. If this strike also results in a **critical hit**, you may **repeat** the effect with the opposite end as another free action :f: (this strike **does not count** towards your multiple attack penalty).
* **A Rank**: **Peircing Spear** - When you **strike** a creature by throwing your weapon, it pierces through, targeting **all creatures** in a line equal to your **thrown range**.
