# Servant Class: Caster ((Main info))
Class Caster, Magus and Heroic Spirit of Spells and Sorcery, is one of the Four Cavalry Classes among the seven standard Servant classes summoned for the Holy Grail War. Servants placed within this Class are usually adept in magecraft, and the only qualifying condition is the mastery of sorceries of the highest caliber compared to the specific parameter requirements of the other classes. Due to not requiring any strong statistics, they generally have low combat abilities, and due to the majority of Servants having some form of **Magic Resistance**, this Class is thought to be the weakest of all seven. They make up for this with other means, using magecraft that no longer exists in the current age and, no matter which Heroic Spirit is of which Class, possessing many possible ploys to be used against enemies. Those of the Saber Class can likely challenge any Caster who uses magecraft as their main offensive ability without needing to plan due to their high Magic Resistance, while those of lesser resistance like the Rider Class may require more strategy. Their class abilities are **Territory Creation**, altering the surrounding lands in favor of their sorcery, and **Item Construction**, which allows the magus to create magical items and tools.ts.

## Hit Points((+Hit Points))

6 plus your Constitution Modifier. 
You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.
)
# Servant Proficency((+Servant Proficency))

As a servant, your initial proficiencies function in a different manner compared to standard classes. 
Whenever your proficiency rank in **Attacks** and **Defenses** would normally increase to match your current rank, increase it by one additional rank instead (for example: if you are a fighter with a master proficiency in melee weapons at level 1, once your fighter class grants you master proficiency in weapons, your proficiency would then increase to legendary). This is capped at one rank above legendary, which is termed 'mythical,' resulting in an additional +2 on top.

## Spirutal body((+Spirutal body))
Servants are made of **Ether** one of **Five Great Elements**, on it's own it is amorphous and is incapable of materializing by its own power, with the power of the grail, the servants are able to gain a material form with a **Spiritual Core** serving as "their center, their heart, their CPU" that dictates their every function. While a servant may bleed and take damage to their organs, their true being resides in a Spiritual Core.

Servants are beings able to **switch** between a **Spiritual Body** and **Material Body** at will, although at a rate no faster than **once per minute**. While in spiritual form, they cannot be easily detected by enemies due to being **invisible** to the naked eye and most forms of scrying, or be affected by physical interference. They can travel where they please without being impeded by walls, but they also **cannot carry anything** in that state. Their senses are limited to spiritual sensations (*a sort of vague sense imagine being in the etheral plane but without your normal senses*), so they must materialize in order to fully experience normal senses when sharing a visual link with their Master. Their upkeep cost is low when not materialized, so many Masters prefer them to stay in spirit form when they are not fighting or doing other tasks that require them to be in physical form to lower the cost on themselves.
=
Other servants can easily sense and interact with a servant in spirit form, while a magus may find it difficult to do so.

***While in spirit form, your speed doubles, but you incur a -4 status penalty to AC (Armor Class), Perception and reflex saves, you are also flat-footed. Additionally, you are unable to make attacks or cast spells.***

## Dying and unconsious conditions((+Dying and unconsious))

As a servant, you do not fall unconscious when reduced to 0 hit points. Instead, you maintain consciousness but incur a **penalty** equal to **twice** your **dying value** on all rolls (such as damage rolls, saves, and checks).

Note that it is still possible to acquire the **unconscious condition** through other means.

Additionally, effects with the **death trait** that reduce your hit points to 0 only increase your dying value by 3, instead of causing immediate death.

###COUNTERSPELL
item(
#Counterspell :r: 
-
**Trigger** A creature Casts a Spell that you have prepared
-
When a foe Casts a Spell and you can see its manifestations, you can use your magic to disrupt it. You expend a prepared spell to counter the triggering creature’s casting of that same spell. You lose your spell slot as if you had cast the triggering spell. You then attempt to counteract the triggering spell (page 431).
**Special** This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast (arcane, divine, primal, or occult).

)
###SORCERY MAKER
As a Caster, you have achieved absolute mastery over magecraft. In your time, you have discovered, created, or acquired special magecraft close to the level of True Magic, qualifying you to be part of this class.

item(
# SORCERY MAKER
-
You gain an extra spell at each even spell rank currently available to you. These spells are always prepared and do not consume spell slots when cast but can only be cast once per day. These spells are part of your identity as a caster, integral to your legend and past. Work together with your GM to create them as you level up in this class. These spells are generally stronger than other spells of the same level; they may be an upgraded version of an existing spell or a completely new and unprecedented spell. Here are some general guidelines for these extra spells:
)

####Spell damage (cringe)
item(
 **AOE**: Around 4d6 damage per spell rank for a ~20ft burst or ~30ft cone. Line spells deal around 5d6 damage per rank instead.
**spell attack roll**: Around 3d12 damage per spell rank.
)
####spell effects (balling)
item(
 **AOE spell** : Approximately 2 spell effects on a success, 3 on a fail, 4 on a critical failure.
**spell attack roll**: 1 spell effect on a hit, 2 on a critical success.
)
####Utility spells (eyo wtf)
item(
This category does not have any specific numbers due to its inconsistency. As a rule of thumb, utility spells that buff or debuff are weaker the longer their duration. A standard duration is 1 minute; as spell durations extend beyond that, they become increasingly weaker.
)
=
####Spell rank variations (how do you even balance this?)
item(
As the spell rank increases, the general rules loosen and become less strict.
)

###TERITORY CREATION
Territory Creation is the Skill needed to build a special terrain that is advantageous to oneself as a magus, such as for the purpose of collecting mana, create magic objects, or perform other tasks. At Rank B, the creation of a Workshop territory becomes possible. 
At Rank A it is possible to create a superior Temple. It is a Class Skill of the Caster-class.
Territories can look different depending on the Servant, as each has their own purpose in mind for the territory they create. For example, a standard magus Servant typically creates a territory where they can experiment and practice magecraft, while an artist Servant may create a Study or Performance Venue.
item(
#Territory Creation
-
* **D Rank**: You can create a workshop suitable for a specific activity of your choosing, such as healing, crafting, or cooking. All **rolls by you and your allies related to that activity** are made twice, and you use the better result, as long as you are within your workshop. Creating a workshop requires **8 hours of downtime**, during which you must not wander away from the spot where the workshop will be created. The size of the workshop at this rank is fairly small, fitting around a small shack or a single room in a house. **You can only have one workshop at a time**.
* **C Rank**: Your workshop now provides all the tools necessary for the activity it was created for, as well as giving a **+2 bonus to those rolls**. The size of your workshop can be as big as a full house.
* **B Rank**: Your workshop now becomes a **Bounded Field** and gains the same properties and requirements. Additionally, all **downtime activities**, as well as the frequency of such activities, are **twice as fast** inside your workshop than outside. This includes resting, treating wounds, refocusing, etc. Your workshop can be the size of a castle.
After creating your workshop, you may **enhance** it into a variant capable of aiding you even further. If the location of your workshop is **on top of or within the vicinity of a Ley Line**, you may spend **8 hours each day for up to 7 days** connecting your workshop to the Ley Lines. By the end of this period, the **spell DC** of your Bounded Field **increases by 5**, and you gain the ability to **share one of your current class abilities** (whether servant or not) with all allies within 
)
|
item (
        the Bounded Field **except for yourself**. This could 
        be either giving a class feat to them or sharing a 
        complete class skill with them.
* **A Rank**: Your workshop becomes a Temple and now **affects all activities instead of just a specific one**. 
If your Temple is connected to a Ley Line, you and all allies inside it gain **an extra charge of your NPs**. You can also use the Ley Line to substitute for your own magical reserves; **all spells you and your allies cast within the workshop do not use spell slots**, and this also affects **charges for magic items**.

* **EX Rank**: If your Temple is connected to a Ley Line, instead of adding a single charge to your and your allies' NPs, **double their maximum charges or increase it by 2**, whichever is higher. You also have **absolute control over the environment and conditions within the Temple**. You can alter the internal space to imitate any sort of landscape, expand or shrink the interior space, change the time flow to be twice as fast or half as fast, and make gravity lighter or heavier.

)

####Bounded Fields
A Bounded Field is a geographical form of Magecraft whereby one knits a boundary line of Magical Energy around a space to separate its inside from the outside, cutting off and isolating that space from the outside worldand then imposing an effect on the inside (or the boundary line itself). It is primarily used to protect one's body or property.
When a Bounded Field is created, **a spell slot must be expended**, and several magic circles need to be spread around the area to keep it stable. At least **1 magic circle** needs to be created for **each 100 feet** within the Bounded Field.
item(
The Bounded Field provides several benefits:
###Isolation and Concealment
The Bounded Field isolates an area from the outside world, creating a separate space of its own. This creates an illusion that allows the mage to control how the inside view appears from the outside. Even creatures with abilities that let them see through illusions must **attempt a check against the mage's spell DC**. The Bounded Field is also under the effects of the **Veil of Privacy spell**, at a spell rank equal to that of the **spell slot** consumed when **creating the Bounded Field**.
###Protection
The Bounded Field also protects the area from intruders. Unless permitted by the mage, no creature can enter the Bounded Field unless they succeed at **a counteract check against the mage's spell DC**.
)
=
item(
The check itself can be caused by anything the GM deems capable of bypassing or opening the Bounded Field, such as an Arcana check to try and disable part of the barrier, a Thievery check made by an expert in magical devices, or even an attack roll made by a magical weapon under the correct circumstances.
All these different options may **change the DC at the GM's discretion**. Even effects that cover large areas do not affect the inside of a Bounded Field if they originate from the outside.
Here are the results of the counteract check:
**Critical Success**: You pass through the barrier or create an opening for your allies to go through **without raising any suspicion**.
**Success**: You pass through the barrier or create an opening for your allies to go through, but whoever is inside **the Bounded Field and its caster are made aware of the intrusion**.
**Failure**: You fail to break through the barrier, and whoever is inside the Bounded Field and its caster are made aware of the intrusion.
**Critical Failure**: As failure, **but you cannot attempt an intrusion with the same check for 1 minute**.
)

###ITEM CONSTRUCTION
Item Construction is the Skill to manufacture magical items, from implements of war to items for daily use. Also, this Skill requires time to gather components and manufacture items.
Item(
#Item Construction
-
* **D Rank**: You do not need a **specific feat** to craft items, such as Alchemical Crafting for alchemical items. You can complete your crafting **in 8 hours** instead of requiring **2 to 1 day of work**. After the first 8 hours, you may choose to continue working an **extra 8 hours**, instead of a day, to decrease the cost of the item before completion. Additionally, you do not need to meet **proficiency level requirements** to craft items.
* **C Rank**: You gain a **+2 bonus** to your Crafting checks. When crafting, you are always considered to be using a **formula** and may create a formula for any item you could craft. If one of the requirements for crafting the item is **casting a certain number of spells**, you do not need to do so.
* **B Rank**: You have learned to utilize all materials to their best potential; all materials you use count **as high-grade materials**. Furthermore, when you craft items, you may **add an additional benefit** to them, such as an ability or passive effect.
)
|
item(
* **A Rank**: You can now **craft items of any level**, even if your level is lower than the item's level. Additionally, you can craft items that do not exist yet. Work with your GM and use the **Building Items rules in GM Core pg. 130** as a basis for your magic items.
* **EX Rank**: You have mastered the art of item construction to a supernatural level. **You do not need materials to craft any items**. You can now **mix and match the properties and features** of items you get a hold of, transferring abilities from one to another or removing curses etc... This can only be used after items have been created and **not before**, and it changes the item's levels accordingly. You also **automatically critically succeed** at crafting any item of your level or lower.
)

###Noble phantasms ((+Noble Phantasms))
Noble phantasms are powerful armaments made using human imagination as their core, and are the weapons and/or abilities owned by Heroic Spirits. As humanity's illusions, **they embody the ultimate Mysteries of a hero as symbols of their existence through historical fact and anecdotes**.

They can be physical weaponry (e.g. swords, spears, bows) or support items (e.g. shields, rings, crowns).They can also be abstractions such as unique, often magical abilities (even close to or matching True Magic), unique (even conceptual) means of attack, curses, and changes to the very environment and its physical properties. When summoned as Servants in the Holy Grail War, they are the trump cards of the heroes that allow them to overcome others in battle.

A servant may possess more than one Noble Phantasm; however, the more they have, the weaker each tends to be compared to possessing a single Noble Phantasm. Noble Phantasms also follow the skill ranking system **(D | C | B | A | EX)**, with higher-ranked Noble Phantasms being more powerful.

Noble Phantasms are classified by their effectiveness against enemies. One Noble Phantasm may have multiple classifications depending on its abilities. The classification and properties of the Noble Phantasm dictate both the number of times it can be used and the duration required for the NP to 'recharge'.

* **Anti-Unit**- Anti-Unit Noble Phantasms are those specialized against defeating other people in single combat. Compared to stronger weapons, a majority of Anti-Unit Noble Phantasms will not go beyond defeating other beings.
=
* **Anti-Army** - Anti-Army Noble Phantasms are those with a wide enough range to be specialized against armies. They are more powerful weapons than Anti-Unit Noble Phantasms, capable of
easily blowing them away, but they must be used more wisely because of their larger cost.

* **Anti-Fortress**  - This rank has powerful Noble Phantasms that can even blow away solid fortified structures. While the difference between Anti-Unit and Anti-Army is the variation in area of effect, Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasms are distinguished from other categories by the great difference in power.
* **Barrier** - The classification of Noble Phantasms used to create barriers, typically Bounded Fields, but it does not include those that are also used to attack.

There are numerous additional classifications for Noble Phantasms, including but not limited to Anti-Self, Anti-Country, and Anti-Purge.

###Class Skills and Personal Skills ((+Class and Personal skills))
Skills are the embodiment of a Servant's various abilities and characteristics, (Riding skill, Presence Concealment etc). They are divided into two main categories: **Class Skills**, which are typically connected to the Servant's Class, and **Personal Skills**, which reflect abilities or anecdotes connected to the life and legend of the Servant themselves, Personal Skills typically outweigh Class Skills in impact.


Again, a servant may possess numerous Class and Personal Skills; however, they tend to be stronger when their number is fewer.
info (
# Progression ((+Progression))
* **Class Skills**: From level 1, you have access to all your Class Skills, but they all start at their lowest rank, D. To progress a particular skill, you must retake the corresponding feat, which will increase its rank by one degree. This approach provides an incredible amount of versatility in your choice of Class Skills. All servant classes begin with one or two Class Skills at level 1 and acquire additional skills as they level up.
* **Personal Skills**: Similar to Class Skills, Personal Skills start at rank D and progress in the same manner, requiring the retaking of the same Personal Skills. The key difference is that Personal Skills progress at a much slower rate, starting at level 3 and advancing every 3 levels (as indicated by the ***'+++'*** symbol in the advancement table on page 2). Additionally, Personal Skills are not provided by the class and must be created in collaboration with your Dungeon Master."
)
|
info(
* **Noble phantasms**:Noble Phantasms follow the same progression rules as Personal Skills, with the difference being that they advance at an even slower rate, starting at level 3 and increasing at level 7, 10, 15 and 20. This progression allows for a maximum of six advancements in a Noble Phantasm.
The classification of a Noble Phantasm also plays a significant role. It is highly unlikely for a servant to possess more than one Anti-Army or Anti-Fortress NP, whereas an Anti-Unit NP is subject to fewer restrictions.
# A RANK
Your skills can only get to A Rank after reaching **level 10**. If your class provides you with a class skill advancement that would increase your rank to A before level 10, you may **substitute** that advancement with a **Caster feat** appropriate for your level.
# EX RANK
It is impossible to reach an EX rank simply by retaking a Class or Personal Skill from A rank. The only way to attain EX rank is through an **in-game secret**, which you may or may not discover. (To clarify, uncovering the secret will increase your rank by one and unlock the potential to reach EX rank, but it will not grant EX rank immediately, unless you are already at A rank in that specific skill).
)
## The Master's Staff 2nd
You react instantly to any threat against your master. When your master is attacked by an enemy or affected by a hazard, you can immediately intervene. You gain the Master's Staff reaction, allowing you to cast a spell targeting either your master or the offender, ensuring their safety or delivering retribution, all in the blink of an eye.
###The Master's Staff :r:

A skill that represents the ability and knowledge of how to use the magic of the Modern Era or is simply the natural talent of a servant when it comes to weilding magic allowing them to easily use magecraft.
