# Servant Class: Saber ((Main info))
Class Saber, Knight of the Sword, is one of the Three Knight Classes among the seven standard Servant classes summoned for the Holy Grail War. Servants placed within this class are agile and powerful melee warriors adept at swordsmanship, boasting high ratings in all categories, and they are often heroes from the Age of Gods when magecraft was still commonplace. The standard opinion is that the Saber Class is the best of the seven classes and the strongest of the Servants. They will generally have an overwhelming advantage over Caster-class Servants who use magecraft as their main offensive ability due to their **Magic Resistance** Skill. The weakness of the class is its straightforwardness in battle, "only" able to attack the enemy with their sword while unable to resort to other tactics like the **Presence Concealment** of the Assassin Class.

At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.

|

## Hit Points ((+Hit Points))

10 plus your Constitution Modifier. 
You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.
)
# Servant Proficency ((+Servant Proficency))

As a servant, your initial proficiencies function in a different manner compared to standard classes. 
Whenever your proficiency rank in **Attacks** and **Defenses** would normally increase to match your current rank, increase it by one additional rank instead (for example: if you are a fighter with a master proficiency in melee weapons at level 1, once your fighter class grants you master proficiency in weapons, your proficiency would then increase to legendary). This is capped at one rank above legendary, which is termed 'mythical,' resulting in an additional +2 on top.

## Spirutal body ((+Spirutal body))
Servants are made of **Ether** one of **Five Great Elements**, on its own it is amorphous and is incapable of materializing by its own power, with the power of the grail, the servants are able to gain a material form with a **Spiritual Core** serving as "their center, their heart, their CPU" that dictates their every function. While a servant may bleed and take damage to their organs, their true being resides in a Spiritual Core.

Servants are beings able to **switch** between a **Spiritual Body** and **Material Body** at will, although at a rate no faster than **once per minute**. While in spiritual form, they cannot be easily detected by enemies due to being **invisible** to the naked eye and most forms of scrying, or be affected by physical interference. They can travel where they please without being impeded by walls, but they also **cannot carry anything** in that state. Their senses are limited to spiritual sensations (*a sort of vague sense imagine being in the ethereal plane but without your normal senses*), so they must materialize in order to fully experience normal senses when sharing a visual link with their Master. Their upkeep cost is low when not materialized, so many Masters prefer them to stay in spirit form when they are not fighting or doing other tasks that require them to be in physical form to lower the cost on themselves.

Other servants can easily sense and interact with a servant in spirit form, while a magus may find it difficult to do so.

***While in spirit form, your speed doubles, but you incur a -4 status penalty to AC (Armor Class), Perception, and reflex saves, you are also flat-footed. Additionally, you are unable to make attacks or cast spells.***
=
## Dying and unconsious conditions ((+Dying and unconsious))

As a servant, you do not fall unconscious when reduced to 0 hit points. Instead, you maintain consciousness but incur a **penalty** equal to **twice** your **dying value** on all rolls (such as damage rolls, saves, and checks).

Note that it is still possible to acquire the **unconscious condition** through other means.

Additionally, effects with the **death trait** that reduce your hit points to 0 only increase your dying value by 3, instead of causing immediate death.

##Class features ((class features))
You gain these abilities as a Saber. Abilities gained at higher levels list the level at which you gain them next to the features’ names.

###REACTIVE STRIKE
Ever watchful for weaknesses, you can quickly attack foes that leave an opening in their defenses. You gain the Reactive strike reaction.

item(
# Reactive strike :r: 
-
**Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
-
)
|
item(
You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action.

This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.
)
###RIDING
A skill that denotes a Servants ability to ride mounts and vehicles.

item(
#Riding skill
-
* **D rank**: Capable of riding familiar animals and vehicles from your past life.

)

###MAGIC RESISTANCE ((+Magic resistance))

* **EX rank**: "**Ma##C? On M#eE#eE?**" You **reflect** spells back to the caster when you **succeed at a counteract check** or **saving throw** against a spell.

)

###Noble phantasms ((+Noble Phantasms))
Noble phantasms are powerful armaments made using human imagination as their core, and are the weapons and/or abilities owned by Heroic Spirits. As humanity's illusions, **they embody the ultimate Mysteries of a hero as symbols of their existence through historical fact and anecdotes**.

They can be physical weaponry (e.g. swords, spears, bows) or support items (e.g. shields, rings, crowns). They can also be abstractions such as unique, often magical abilities (even close to or matching True Magic), unique (even conceptual) means of attack, curses, and changes to the very environment and its physical properties. When summoned as Servants in the Holy Grail War, they are the trump cards of the heroes that allow them to overcome others in battle.

A servant may possess more than one Noble Phantasm; however, the more they have, the weaker each tends to be compared to possessing a single Noble Phantasm. Noble Phantasms also follow the skill ranking system **(D | C | B | A | EX)**, with higher-ranked Noble Phantasms being more powerful.

Noble Phantasms are classified by their effectiveness against enemies. One Noble Phantasm may have multiple classifications depending on its abilities. The classification and properties of the Noble Phantasm dictate both the number of times it can be used and the duration required for the NP to 'recharge'.

* **Anti-Unit**- Anti-Unit Noble Phantasms are those specialized against defeating other people in single combat. Compared to stronger weapons, a 
|
        majority of Anti-Unit Noble Phantasms will not 
        go beyond defeating other beings.

* **Anti-Army** - Anti-Army Noble Phantasms are those with a wide enough range to be specialized against armies. They are more powerful weapons than Anti-Unit Noble Phantasms, capable of easily blowing them away, but they must be used more wisely because of their larger cost.
* **Anti-Fortress**  - This rank has powerful Noble Phantasms that can even blow away solid fortified structures. While the difference between Anti-Unit and Anti-Army is the variation in area of effect, Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasms are distinguished from other categories by the great difference in power.
* **Barrier** - The classification of Noble Phantasms used to create barriers, typically Bounded Fields, but it does not include those that are also used to attack.

There are numerous additional classifications for Noble Phantasms, including but not limited to Anti-Self, Anti-Country, and Anti-Purge.

###Class Skills and Personal Skills ((+Class and Personal skills))
Skills are the embodiment of a Servant's various abilities and characteristics (Riding skill, Magic Resistance etc). They are divided into two main categories: **Class Skills**, which are typically connected to the Servant's Class, and **Personal Skills**, which reflect abilities or anecdotes connected to the life and legend of the Servant themselves. Personal Skills typically outweigh Class Skills in impact.

Again, a servant may possess numerous Class and Personal Skills; however, they tend to be stronger when their number is fewer.
info (
# Progression ((+Progression))
* **Class Skills**: From level 1, you have access to all your Class Skills, but they all start at their lowest rank, D. To progress a particular skill, you must retake the corresponding feat, which will increase its rank by one degree. This approach provides an incredible amount of versatility in your choice of Class Skills. All servant classes begin with two Class Skills at level 1 and acquire additional skills as they level up.
* **Personal Skills**: Similar to Class Skills, Personal Skills start at rank D and progress in the same manner, requiring the retaking of the same Personal Skills. The key difference is that Personal Skills progress at a much slower rate, starting at level 3 and advancing every 3 levels (as indicated by the ***'+++'*** symbol in the advancement table on page 2). Additionally, Personal Skills are not provided by the class and must be created in collaboration with your Dungeon Master."
)
=
info (
* **Noble phantasms**: Noble Phantasms follow the same progression rules as Personal Skills, with the difference being that they advance at an even slower rate, starting at level 5 and increasing every 5 levels. This progression allows for a maximum of four advancements in a Noble Phantasm. The classification of a Noble Phantasm also plays a significant role. It is highly unlikely for a servant to possess more than one Anti-Army or Anti-Fortress NP, whereas an Anti-Unit NP is subject to fewer restrictions.
# A RANK
Your skills can only get to A Rank after reaching **level 10**. If your class provides you with a class skill advancement that would increase your rank to A before level 10, you may **substitute** that advancement with a **Saber feat** appropriate for your level.
# EX RANK
It is impossible to reach an EX rank simply by retaking a Class or Personal Skill from A rank. The only way to attain EX rank is through an **in-game secret**, which you may or may not discover. (To clarify, uncovering the secret will increase your rank by one and unlock the potential to reach EX rank, but it will not grant EX rank immediately, unless you are already at A rank in that specific skill).
)

## The Master's blade 2nd
With unwavering vigilance, you protect your master from harm, swiftly intercepting any attacks directed at them. You gain the Master's Blade reaction, enabling you to use your weapon to protect your Master from harm's way.


###The Master's Blade :r: 
-

**Trigger** Your master is attacked by an enemy while they are within your movement speed + reach.

item(

If your strike roll exceeds the attack roll, you successfully deflect the attack, preventing it from hitting your master.

This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.

#Battle Continuation
-

#INDEPENDENT ACTION (NEEDS REWORK)
-
Independent Action is the ability to remain independent even when rejecting the Magical Energy supply from one's Master; the ability that allows for action even in the absence of the Master. Independent Action is the Class Skill of the Archer class.
)
=
item(
At higher ranks, Servants can stay in this world longer without a contract, independently from the Master's Magical Energy. This allows Masters to focus on larger spells, or maintain the Servant even if they're unable to supply Magical Energy due to injury. However, these Servants are harder to control and retain, making Command Spells the only reliable method of commanding them.

* **D Rank**: It is possible for a Servant to stay in the world for **eight hours without a Master**.
* **C Rank**: It is possible for a Servant to stay in the world for **one day without a Master**.
* **B Rank**: It is possible for a Servant to stay in the world for **two days without a Master**. However, this is the ideal value achieved by maximally conserving mana and avoiding battle and NP usage.
* **A Rank**: It is possible to take action even without a Master. However, to use NPs of great magical energy consumption, backup from the Master is necessary. At Rank A, it is possible for a Servant to stay in the world for about **a week without a Master**.
* **EX Rank**: At EX rank, Independent Action allows for nearly any act, whether related to combat or otherwise, to be undertaken without support from the Master.
